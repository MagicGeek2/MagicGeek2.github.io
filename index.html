        In the beginning, Tim created the HyperText Markup Language. The
        Internet was without form and void, and text was upon the face of
        the monitor and the Hands of Tim were moving over the face of the
        keyboard. And Tim said, Let there be links; and there were links.
        And Tim saw that the links were good; and Tim separated the links
        from the text. Tim called the links Anchors, and the text He
        called Other Stuff. And the whole thing together was the first
        Web Page.
